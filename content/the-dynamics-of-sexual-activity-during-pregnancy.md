Pregnancy is a profound and transformative experience that can bring about a multitude of changes in a woman’s body, emotions, and relationships. One aspect that often raises questions is sexual activity. While societal norms and personal beliefs may influence perceptions of sex during pregnancy, understanding the medical and emotional landscapes can help navigate this intimate terrain with confidence and care.

For most women, engaging in sexual activity during a healthy pregnancy is safe. The female body undergoes significant changes, including hormonal fluctuations that can enhance libido for some women. Medical experts often affirm that, in the absence of complications, sexual intercourse poses no risk to the fetus. The baby is well-protected within the amniotic sac, and the cervix remains closed, safeguarding against potential harm.

However, certain medical conditions may necessitate caution. Pregnant individuals with a history of preterm labor, cervical insufficiency, placenta previa, or other complications should consult their healthcare provider before engaging in sexual activity.
