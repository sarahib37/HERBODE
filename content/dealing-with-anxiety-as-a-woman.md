Anxiety is a phenomenon experienced by 23.4% of women and non binary people, higher than the 14.3% present in men. In a nutshell, anxiety can be defined as, “a feeling of fear, dread, and uneasiness. It might cause you to sweat, feel restless and tense, and have a rapid heartbeat. It can be a normal reaction to stress” by Medline. 


Anxiety is a relatively common phenomenon with presentations in 31.1% of the adults in the United States. To read more on anxiety and anxiety disorders click [here](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anxiety/symptoms-causes/syc-20350961).

With the state of the world, it is not unusual that even more people suffer from anxiety. From the genocide occuring in Gaza, Palestine, to the humanitarian crises going on from everywhere in Plateau State, Nigeria, to Sudan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tigray, Yemen, and so many more. Consuming as much media as we currently do about so much chaos is unhealthy, and is definitely enough to make anyone anxious. There is so much going on in the world, and that alone is enough to disorient anyone. Even the economy is difficult, and so many people are only a few financial changes from homelessness. There is so much going on, that the feeling of fear is barely ever leaving. 

Knowing all of these things, how does one cope with anxiety as a woman/person living in these times? Below are some of our tips:

#### 1. Ground Yourself

There are many easy ways to do this, but the most obvious one is to take off your footwear and feel the ground beneath you. Feel the solid ground, and try to assure yourself, it is the one consistent thing. The one sure thing. The ground beneath you is solid, and in that moment, it should be enough. 

Other grounding options include activities like gardening, journaling, counting exercises, and sitting with your back against a wall. You could also place a palm, splayed against your chest and hold it there. It had the same feeling as getting a hug, and if a tight one is what you need, you can squeeze, too. Right under your left breast. Just splay a palm there and hold yourself. Feel your heartbeat. 

#### 2. Distract Yourself

While it may seem like it is terrible timing to do so, taking a minute away from things is very healthy, and might very well be the difference between you making a true difference or not. Take in deep breaths, and count through to six when you pull then in, four when you let them out. 

Think, what are 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste? Switch it up if you like. The point is to remind you of certain constants in the moment, to help you process.  You can also follow the 3-3-3 rule, where you look around to identify 3 objects and 3 sounds, then move 3 body parts. 

#### 3. Jar Yourself

Might seem counterproductive, but shock yourself. Listen to a new genre of music, or one you haven’t heard in a while. 

Watch a movie you’ve been putting off,  something that removes you wholly from the phase of mind you were at prior to the anxiety attack.

#### 4. Feel It

Cry. Be sad. Be angry. 

Some other treatment options include, and are not limited to:
- Therapy – from Cognitive Behavioural Therapy to immersion and other forms.
- Aromatherapy
- Exercise
- Dietary and Lifestyle changes, etc.


To every woman and person suffering from anxiety out there, we assure you, you are not alone, and we see you, we hear you, and we hope ease visits you very soon.
