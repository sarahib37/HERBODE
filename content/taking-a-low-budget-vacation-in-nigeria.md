- **Travel during the off-season:** Avoid visiting popular destinations during peak holiday periods when prices are typically higher. The rainy season (May-September) can offer cheaper accommodation and flights. We know it may reduce your steeze and prevent you from having a hot girl summer, but a vacation is still a vacation, no?

- **Opt for budget-friendly accommodations:** Look for affordable hostels, budget hotels, or Airbnbs instead of high-end resorts. Research online reviews to find clean, safe, and well-located options. Remember, the goal is to have a place to come back to after touring all day, so just find a comfortable place and plan all your adventures from there.

- **Use public transportation:** Embrace buses, trains, and shared taxis instead of taxis or car rentals to get around. This can be much cheaper, especially for solo travelers.

- **Explore free or low-cost activities:** Visit museums, markets, parks, and historical sites that offer free or low-cost admission. Take walking tours to discover a city’s highlights.

- **Eat like a local:** Avoid tourist traps and dine at local, family-owned restaurants or street food vendors. This not only saves money but also allows you to experience authentic Nigerian cuisine.

- **Book bundled packages:** Look for travel agencies or websites that offer package deals including flights, accommodations, and activities at discounted rates.

- **Use mobile apps and online resources:** Apps like TripAdvisor, Airbnb, and Skyscanner can help you find the best deals on flights, accommodations, and activities.

- **Pack light:** Avoid checked baggage fees by packing only essentials in a carry-on bag. This also makes it easier to use public transportation.

- **Leverage your network:** Connect with locals or expats who can provide insider tips on budget-friendly options and hidden gems.

- **Be flexible with your travel dates:** Adjusting your travel dates by a day or two can sometimes lead to significant savings on flights and accommodations.

- **Look into package trips:** You can consider the option of traveling with a group or just planning something with your close friends or even distant friends. Aside from helping you cut costs, this can be a good way to meet new people, bond , share memories, gain new experiences and a way to know each other better.
