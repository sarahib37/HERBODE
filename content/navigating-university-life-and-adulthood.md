#### Introduction

It’s a huge feat gaining admission into the university, it’s a thing of pride to your parents and of course, yourself. Stepping into the university feels like entering a new world that is filled with excitement and a sense of independence. It’s a world of self-discovery, learning, friendships, parties and relationships. However, as thrilling as this phase is, it also comes with its challenges from academic pressures, finances and the system just working against you especially if you attend a public university.  It can also be a place to make bad decisions, a place to regret, and a place to cry. If you grew up watching Yoruba movies, old nollywood movies, or foreign films, you might have had a certain image of university life which is carefree, fun-filled parties and events, opposite sex, dating, cliques and generally glamorous. But reality often proves to be quite different; however, a fair balance on both can be achieved. 

#### Navigating University Life

1. **Academic and Time Management**

University is definitely different from secondary schools. It requires discipline and adaptability. The workload can be intense as well as deadlines. You may be tempted to not attend classes because sometimes they can be overwhelming.

  - **Handling Coursework:** Prioritize Tasks; list all your assignments, projects, deadlines. Complete high-priority tasks with close gap deadlines first to avoid last-minute stress. Utilize textbooks and materials (there are many free resources on the internet), and join study groups.
  - **Balancing Studies and Extracurriculars:** Finding a balance between academic responsibilities and personal interest is important. This can be achieved by developing a weekly or monthly planner that includes classes, study sessions, and extracurricular activities. Map out specific times for studying, attending lectures, and completing assignments. This visual representation helps you see where your time is going and ensures you allocate enough time for each commitment.
  - **Set Specific Goals:**  Break large tasks into smaller, manageable goals. For instance, instead of saying “I need to study for my exam” , set a goal like, “I will review chapter 3 and 4 today”. This makes the workload feel less overwhelming and allows for a sense of achievement as you complete each goal.
  - **Limit Distractions:** Identify what distracts you the most, whether it’s social media, noise, or even certain environments. Create a conducive study space, use apps that block distractions, and set specific times for breaks to recharge without losing focus.
  - **Stay Flexible:** While having a structured plan is important, be prepared to adjust it as needed. Life can be unpredictable, and being adaptable will help you manage unexpected changes without feeling overwhelmed.
  - **Time Management Tips:** Using planners such as Google Calendar, prioritizing tasks by categorising them as urgent-important, important-not urgent, urgent-not important, or not, and avoiding procrastination. It may help to use the Pomodoro Technique of working in focused 25-minute sessions followed by a 5-minute break.

2. **Social Life and Networking**

Building relationships is a fundamental part of university life, but it comes with its own set of challenges. It’s important to note that relationships are not limited to romantic relationships. Networking with peers and faculty can lead to opportunities for internships and job placements.

  - **Making Friends and Building Connections:** University is a place where you meet people of cultures and backgrounds with Nigeria being a country with diverse ethnic groups and culture which offers an opportunity to learn more about others and form relationships. Keep an open mind and connect with people.
  - **Dealing with Peer Pressure:** While it is beautiful to network and form relationships. Some individuals find it difficult to start a friendship, trust, begin a romantic relationship or attend events and may feel some type of pressure because everyone is attending the party or event or everyone is making friends or everyone is dating. It’s okay to take it one step at a time and be comfortable in whatever decision that is being taken regarding oneself regardless of societal expectations.
  - **Networking for Career Growth:** Engaging in events, joining organisations or clubs, volunteering, internships, and mentorship programs helps to build a strong professional foundation which can come in handy while in school or after university Level.

3. **Independence and Responsibilities**

For many students, university is their first real taste of independence, embracing personal responsibility is key to adulthood. This includes managing finances, making informed decisions, and taking care of your health. Learning to budget, cook, and prioritize self-care are vital skills that will serve you well in the university and even beyond. It’s important to recognize that mistakes are part of the learning process, and seeking help when needed is a sign of strength, not weakness.

  - **Life Skills:** Trying out new stuff, test yourself, push and put yourself out there, try and leave your comfort zone, take up leadership roles in teams, groups, class and see how wonderful you can be. Stay committed to your study plan and avoid procrastination. Developing self-discipline will help you stay on track and achieve your academic goals. You will not always be 100% correct, the university is not only there for academic growth, your mental and emotional growth are also important, one should be open and ready to unlearn and relearn certain ideologies, behaviours, etc.
  - **Managing Finances:** It is important to budget, incorporate the saving culture, your expenditure shouldn’t be higher than income, also there should always be a rainy day stash irrespective of the fact that it rains everyday in Nigeria. 
  - **Make Informed Choices:** Be mindful of the decisions you make regarding your studies, social life, and health. Understanding the consequences of your choices is a key part of personal responsibility. Be observant and cautious of who you spend time with, bear in mind, people aren’t always who they claim to be.
  - **Mental Health and Self-Care:** Academia typically comes with pressure. Take out time to unwind and relax by doing things that help you mentally and cutting down habits or people that do not help your mental health, call-out disrespect when they are directed to you, don’t let people get comfortable speaking down on you or it will never stop. Try as much as possible to be the friend you expect your friends to be to you. Personal well-being is also important, it takes time and money to look and smell good.
  - **Sexual relationships:**  This isn’t something you must engage in, it is something you engage in only when YOU want, not the sexual partner, not your friends, but you alone should want it.

By embracing these principles, you can create a positive and productive university experience that sets you up for future success.

Always, your dreams are valid and no-one including yourself should invalidate it. And finally, if you believe in God, hold God tight.

#### Navigating Adulthood

Let’s be honest, you must have heard or seen the phrase “adulthood na scam” before and trust me it is nothing but the truth. As children we had moments when we couldn’t wait to grow up because we were fascinated by the idea of being grown. However, the transition from university to adulthood often feels like stepping into uncharted territory, where you no longer have the structured environment of school and it is now replaced with the unpredictable realities of the real world. Adulthood can be exciting and challenging. This is where you realize that everything comes down to you. You are responsible for your growth, success and failures. It involves a lot of figuring out oneself, re-starting one’s life, setting goals, going back to the set goals to edit and strategize. Transitioning to adulthood is a journey, and it’s okay to take your time. Be gentle with yourself, and don’t hesitate to seek help when needed. 

Here are some helpful tips to navigate this phase:

1. **Career Readiness and Professional Growth**

While Graduating from university is cool, it doesn’t guarantee success in the job market unfortunately. While you’re waiting for job placements, career preparations such as internships or volunteer opportunities to gain experience and build your resume can be helpful.

  - **Internships, Volunteering, and Side Hustles:** Gaining experience and building a portfolio or starting/building your own brand as a means of getting engaged and/or a means of survival.
  - **Developing Soft and technical Skills:** Effective communication, leadership, time management, problem-solving, and adaptability are examples of soft skills. Technical skills such as Project management, Community management, Data analysis, Virtual assistance, Customer support management, Graphics designing, UIUX designer are handy skills that can be learnt via free resources such as free online schools or platforms such udemy, coursera, etc.
  - **Job Applications and Interviews:** While preparing to apply for jobs, it is important to craft a strong CV or resume, leverage networks and prepare adequately for interviews.

2. **Financial Independence**

“5k here, 12k there and before you know it, 100k don finish”. Managing finances becomes even more important after graduation, learn to manage your finances by budgeting, saving, and understanding credit. This skill is crucial for independence. Though it might seem impossible, your happiness shouldn’t be tied to the amount in your account. learn and seek out other treasures in life like a good nap, a good book, or a good movie to indulge in. 

  - **Emergency Funds and Responsible Spending:** Emergency funds aka vex money is a necessity as an adult because anything can come up at any time which may require funds hence it’s highly recommended that savings are prioritised. While it is good to save, it is better to be responsible about spending, especially if the income is not stable yet.
  - **Understanding Taxes and Investments:** Once you start earning, try to understand how taxes work. In Nigeria, for example, income tax is deducted at source (PAYE) for salary workers. Investments aren’t just for the rich, you can start small and learn with low-risk options but make sure to avoid get rich quick schemes.
  
3. **Personal Growth and Self-Discovery**

Adulthood is not just about securing a career and growing it; it’s also about personal fulfillment.

  - **Finding Purpose and Identity:** Pay attention to what excites you. Is it writing, content creation, tech, fashion, coding, food or business? Take up internships, volunteer, start a side hustle, and explore your hobbies. Develop essential life skills such as cooking, cleaning, and laundry, these skills will help you take care of yourself and your living environment.
  - **Navigating Relationships:** Cultivate meaningful relationships with friends, family, and mentors, a strong support network can provide guidance and encouragement. Maintaining friendships, family ties, and romantic relationships are a part of adulthood as one becomes increasingly busy chasing career and goals and it gets difficult to maintain or build other relationships. As an adult, there will be bad days where you will need your friends, invest in friendships.
  - **Embracing Failures and Learning from Them:** Define your short-term and long-term goals, having clear objectives can help you stay focused and motivated as you navigate adulthood. Adulting is realising that setbacks are a part of growth. Just remember that failure doesn’t define you-; your response does, whether it’s a rejected job application, a breakup or a personal setback like not reaching your goal or target for the moment, never allow it discourage you from trying again. Ensure that these goals are attainable. 

4. **Confidence and Audacity**

Your confidence level really matters, be bold even when you don’t feel like it. You need to have a huge audacity to go through adulthood, the audacity that makes you demand for your voice to be heard in the workplace meeting, the audacity that gets you to talk back at those rude drivers, the audacity that gets you to price those over priced goods at the market. Don’t send anybody’s father, except the fathers that truly matter.

In conclusion, navigating university life and transitioning into adulthood requires a balance of academic diligence, social engagement, and personal responsibility. You can thrive during this pivotal time in your life by mastering these aspects. And if you believe in God, do adulthood with God.
