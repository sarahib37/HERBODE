Herbode is a **Non Governmental Organisation** founded on **August 19, 2023**, by **Sinmiloluwa Isabella Aboluwade**, with one goal in mind, **building a home for victims of domestic abuse**, a place for **women, girls, and enby** to go when they just need a **safe haven**. An **abode**, hence the name **HERBODE**.  


Although this is a long term goal and has yet to be actualized, Herbode is working towards her first project **EDUCATE A GIRL CHILD**. Currently in Nigeria, girls account for 60% of the students out of school due to factors such as **child marriage, poverty and discriminatory societal norms**. Herbode hopes to fund a few girls through school while supporting others with essential school supplies.

Herbode also offers **a safe online space for women** while also sharing **educational contents** across all her social media platforms organizing **X Spaces** so that women can just rant and have fun. This blog is one of the channels that Herbode plans to use to share educative contents and give women an opportunity to share their own stories.
