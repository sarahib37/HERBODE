### When does it end?

#### What is Femicide?

Femicide refers to the intentional killing of women or girls because of their gender. It encompasses a range of gender-based violence, including domestic violence, honor killings, and killings related to sexual violence. 

Femicide is often rooted in systemic gender inequality and societal norms that devalue women, sexism and misogyny. It is a serious and widespread issue in many parts of the world, highlighting the need for legal reforms, societal change, and increased awareness to combat violence against women. It may also be referred to as feminicide.

The topic of femicide in Nigeria is usually met with denial, as most individuals attempt to ignore or dismiss its existence, when in fact, it is a harsh and devastating truth.

 In 2024, over 50 cases of femicide were reported by various news outlets. Many women living in Nigeria face various forms of violence, including domestic violence, sexual assault, and harmful traditional practices, which can lead to femicide. 

Over the years femicide in Nigeria has skyrocketed with the perpetrators being boyfriends, husbands, brothers and even fathers of the women. It is a serious issue that should be addressed. However, these crimes have been reduced to ritual killings and moral lessons for the girl child. Mothers, wives and daughters are being killed everyday but these murders are justified with excuses such as “she cheated” and “she wanted expensive things.” As long as this issue is not tackled, there will be a surge in Femicide in Nigeria.  

#### Causes and Contributing Factors Of Femicide in Nigeria

Femicide is a complex issue in Nigeria. However, understanding the causes and contributing factors will shed more light on the issue. 

The following are the causes and contributing factors to femicide in Nigeria;

- **Cultural and Social Factors:** Nigeria is a country with over 250 ethnic groups, and certain cultural norms, such as forced marriages and child marriages, can lead to femicide. Also, Nigeria is a patriarchal society where men hold significant power and control over women’s lives. All of these factors can increase the incidence of femicide.

- **Economic Factors:** Unemployment, poverty, and women’s economic dependence on men can make women more vulnerable to abuse and femicide.

- **Educational Factors:** Limited access to education and gender-biased education can also increase the likelihood of femicide.

- **Legal and Institutional Factors:** Weak laws, poor enforcement, lack of access to justice, and corruption can also play a role in femicide. 

- **Stigma and Shame:** The stigma and shame attached to broken families and victims of gender based violence by the society can also increase the incidence of femicide.

#### The Impact and Side Effects of Femicide 

The biggest impact of femicide affects the victims of femicide; these women’s rights to life and liberty are violated, and they are deprived of their dreams, aspirations, and loved ones, amongst other things. 

Studies have shown regression in the society’s economy in societies with high rates of violence against women, they are clear social and economic consequences of inaction in recognising the global magnitude of femicide. The economic consequences of femicide on the surviving children is yet to be calculated but the psychological effects of femicide on surviving children is well known. 

There are kids who are uprooted from their homes and into new environments while living with the knowledge that their mother was a victim of femicide. Families and friends might never fully recover from the loss of their loved one. The psychological effects it has on individuals cannot be buttressed enough. Grieving for a loved one who died a somewhat prepared death takes its toll on the people left behind, then how do we imagine the grief for one whose life was cut short?

The media’s role in cases of femicide can be described as two sides of a coin. It’s important that these cases are brought to light and not swept under the carpet. The faces and names of the perpetrators should be easily found on the internet, records of victims should be kept. The other side of the coin comes with femicide desensitization, media headlines sometimes are structured in a way that victimizes the perpetrator, takes away the awareness it is supposed to create, blames the victim for being a victim of femicide, and eradicates the empathic emotions that such cases invoke in humans. Songs which can be an  important way of calling to light an event are used to create catchy jokes about femicide instead of raising awareness, femicides ends up becoming just another news. 

The human rights and justice systems over the years have become very responsive to GBV and its most devastating outcome; femicide. Femicide reviews which can be likened to human rights activists  are a team of stakeholders across sectors like law enforcement, health care, child welfare, and GBV services often with the participation of families and social networks. The idea of a femicide review is to go beyond the decision of individual responsibility and look at the level of social responsibility, the ultimate aim of this review is to identify issues and recommend changes to prevent the occurence of femicide in the future. 

Improvement of criminal justice, health care, and social responses will go a long way in the eradication of femicide. It’s worthy to note that the justice systems found in lawless countries are excluded, the perpetrators of femicide are rarely brought to book. We as a global nation still have a long journey to make regarding femicide and its impact on families.

#### Solutions And The Way Forward: Combatting Femicide In Nigeria

Femicide is not just a statistic or a tragic headline; it’s a reality for women in Nigeria and it demands our collective attention. Every time we hear of another woman’s life being forcefully taken by violence, it serves as a harsh reminder that the battle is far from over. But the fight against femicide is not one we must face alone. It’s a fight that calls on every part of our society whether government, law enforcement agencies,organisations or foundations and even private individuals alike to come together and work towards creating change 

#### Legal and Policy Reforms: Making Laws Matter

The Federal Republic of Nigeria does not have a law against femicide but we have laws in place, like the Violence Against Persons Prohibition Act (VAPP), which on paper, should protect everyone including women however, the truth is, these laws aren’t enough if they’re not enforced.According to a report made by former Minister of Women Affairs,Barr. Uju Kennedy in October 2023,“we recorded about 24, 720 cases of various violence cases that were reported across the 36 States and FCT.  We also had 975 fatal cases, 1,505 cases that have been closed either at the court, community level, family, religious/traditional leaders or by the survivors themselves due to fear and intimidation. Also, 8,540 open cases are still pending either at the police station or within the court, while only 306 were convicted and sentenced within the last four years across the country”. Those numbers are far too low for us to claim victory over femicide. 

What we need is a justice system that does more than just pass laws.it needs to make sure they work regardless of status or wealth. Survivors of gender-based violence deserve to see the law take swift action against those who harm them. It will not only create a sense of security amongst women but also send a strong warning to the perpetrators of these acts.The police, the courts, and lawmakers must work together to create a system that values and protects women’s lives. This means not only holding perpetrators accountable but also creating an environment where survivors are supported, not silenced.

#### The Role of Government, NGOs, and Advocacy Groups: A United Front

The truth is, everyone has a part to play in the fight against femicide. The government can’t just hand off responsibility to NGOs; it needs to lead the charge. We need leaders who don’t just speak about the importance of women’s rights but take tangible steps to protect them. It’s not enough to have laws on paper,these laws need to be backed by action, funding, and the political will to make a difference.

And let’s not forget the power of collaboration. NGOs and advocacy groups have been at the forefront, fighting for women’s rights for years. But they can’t do it alone. The education sector, the media, and industries like the movie and music industry must join the conversation and work toward creating a culture that values women’s autonomy.Enough of movies that justify killing women because of their dressing or lyrics such as “if a girl worry me, i delete her.Put her inside a bin bag” If we want to see real change, we need every sector especially to play its part in spreading the message that women’s lives matter and that femicide is unacceptable.

#### Community-Based Solutions: Changing the Narrative

The road to eradicating femicide starts in our communities. It’s time to challenge the attitudes that enable violence against women to continue. For too long, we’ve been fed cautionary tales that tell women how to protect themselves, as if the onus is on them to prevent violence. This needs to change. It’s not about how women behave—it’s about how society treats women. Men are often the ones perpetuating violence, and it’s time to hold them accountable. 

Addressing toxic masculinity is key to breaking this cycle. Many violent acts are rooted in insecurity—when men feel threatened by women’s independence, success, or refusal to conform to traditional gender roles, violence often follows. These behaviors aren’t born out of love or respect—they come from jealousy, fear, and a deep-rooted desire to control. We need to teach men, from an early age, that true strength lies in respect, empathy, and communication. 

We must also empower women to challenge the status quo. Femicide isn’t just a man’s problem; it’s a societal problem. Women need to know their worth and have the courage to stand up against abuse. This can only happen when we create communities where women are not seen as lesser, but as equals deserving of dignity, respect, and safety.

#### What We All Can Do to Combat Femicide

The responsibility of ending femicide does not rest solely with the government or NGOs–it’s on all of us. We all have a role to play. As individuals, we can create change by speaking up when we see violence, questioning harmful stereotypes, and supporting survivors. Every conversation we have, every post we share on social media, every act of solidarity counts. The more we name and shame  femicide, the harder it becomes for these issues to remain in the shadows.

And it’s crucial that we stop blaming women for the violence they face. Survivors of abuse need to feel supported, not judged. We must create an environment where victims can safely speak up, without fear of retaliation or shame. Shelters, legal aid, and counseling services are just a few of the resources we need to ensure that women can rebuild their lives after violence.  Encouraging women to leave toxic situations and providing them with emotional and practical support can be life-saving. A woman’s value is not determined by her marital status, but by her dignity, strength, and ability to live free from harm.We must all stand in solidarity with survivors, not just in words but in action.

#### Conclusion: A Call to Action

Governments, NGOs, communities, and individuals must come together to fight femicide at every level. We need a justice system that protects women, leaders who advocate for their rights, and a society that refuses to tolerate violence against them. 

It’s time for a change; a change that puts women’s lives at the center of our national conversation. Together, we can build a Nigeria where femicide is no longer a reality, but a tragic chapter in our past.
