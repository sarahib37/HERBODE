Recently, a few women have taken to social media to post 'my body , my choice' as a way to reinforce their stand against abortion rights. The phrase challenges the notion that men can have a say over women’s reproductive choices, underscoring the importance of women’s right to make decisions about their own bodies without external pressure.

I asked six women what this mantra means for the average woman trying to reinforce her right as an autonomous person and make decisions that favors her and her body? Here are their responses;

#### Vivian
It can undermine the principle that women should have full control over their own bodies, leading to situations where the man’s choices sort of overpowers her autonomy.
I also think that mentality might encourage coercive behaviors, where men pressures women into decisions regarding their bodies knowing that they can actually do that.

#### Cheche
It definitely upholds the existing power dynamics where men exert control over women’s reproductive rights and health decisions. We’re here trying to dismantle the patriarchy but phrases like these are hurtful to the movement .
This perspective may prioritize male opinions and desires over women’s autonomy, sidelining our needs and experiences.
Isn’t it already happening? With all these ‘ your husband needs to sign this and sign that ‘ they make women go through in hospitals.

It’s obviously very harmful. I think once you take away a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body, you’re basically saying her life is no longer in her hands.

#### Dubem
As a nurse, I can tell you that this didn’t just start with this new madness of a quote going around. Men have had the power when it comes to women and their bodies for so long. The only thing is, modern women are now conforming to it too so it’s gonna be a lot harder to dismantle.

#### Daniella
I don’t think the women chanting this thing are aware of the implications. Now, If a woman is pressured to continue an unwanted pregnancy due to a partner’s choice, say, he’s pro life, she may resort to unsafe methods of abortion, leading to serious health complications or death. 

My aunt died six years ago because of this same thing. She got pregnant and that was the time she got really sick too. The doctor advised her to abort but her husband was very religious so he said no. She had to go through the backyard to get an abortion and it took her life. I don’t think these people understand that a man who you think loves you to death may not exactly make the right choice for you.

Personally, I feel it’s like taking your life and putting it in someone’s hands and that’s crazy. It’s easy to tweet but have they ever imagined the actual implications of a law being made regarding this? You can’t even get any procedure done without your husband signing off on it. You’re practically putting your safety in the hands of a man. A man!!!! Nahhh!!! Imagine needing a necessary reproductive health service like contraception and you have to wait for a man to sign off on it!!! They need to wake up.



The phrase “my body, his choice” underscores the importance of respecting individual autonomy in health decisions. The health implications are significant, affecting not only individuals but also relationships and public health outcomes. Ensuring that women have the right to make informed choices about their own bodies is crucial for promoting overall health and well-being.
